# EPFL - CS107 Project 2

A game inspired from Superpacman built with Java.

## How to launch the game
To run the game just launch the main class from Play.java and choose which mode you want to play.

## Game modes
### Classic Superpacman (Single-Player)
* Mode 1: Just the gameplay you would expect from Superpacman
### Hyperpacman (Multi-Player)
* Mode 2: Hyperpacman (vs mode)

## Controls 
* SuperPacman: Control the player using the directional arrows.
* HyperPacman: Control one player using the directional arrows and the other one using WASD

## Objective of the game
* Mode 1:  Make your way through various puzzles that and complete 3 levels!
* Mode 2: Be the first one to reach the key and win the game!

## How to complete the single-player campaign
### Stage 1
Just take the key and get out of the stage
### Stage 2
Collect all the diamonds (white dots) to open the gate and get out of the stage
### Stage 3
First collect all the keys in order to have access to all the diamonds; then collect all of them and get out of the stage

## Additional features implemented in the game (bonus)
### Timer on the GUI
When you are invulnerable, the life counter tells you for how long you're going to be invincible for.
### Randomly generated mazes
Hyperpacman features randomly generate a maze to make every game different!
### 2 Player mode
A fully functional local multiplayer
### Custom generation for the casual maze
The procedurally generated maze has its own system that can spawn items according to a certain probability.

## Link to external code used to make the game
Nothing was copy-pasted everything, was carefully read and adapted to the needs of the game (as you can see certain resources were in a completely different language).
