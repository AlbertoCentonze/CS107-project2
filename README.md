# Superpacman recreation

Originally an assignment from my university this project is a recreation of Superpacman built in Java and a basic game engine given by EPFL.

I also decided to go further from the original assignment and implement some additional features:
* Random level generation using the Hunt and Kill generation algorithm
* Two local players mode from the same keyboard

To run the game just launch the main class from Play.java and choose which mode you want to play.

## Game modes

* HyperPacman: Control one player using the directional arrows and the other one using WASD

## Objective of the game
